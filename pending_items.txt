List of pending things (TODOs)

1. 	(a) Throughput using number of client requests - Time taken to process a request. 
	Just plot of time taken vs no. of requests is enough. No need to calculate separately.
	(b) Plot of time taken to reach consensus vs number of processes
2. For now manually delete vrpaxos.log file before each run. Need to find out how logger can create a new file/truncate the file at starting of each run. -- done. committed.
3. basic shiviz visualization for raft.da
4. fix missing one or two lines in shiviz log files. This will also fix 2.
	Reason: Logger does not print once or twice due to unknown reasons.
	Possible Solution: Append shiviz logs into temporary buffer inside class and dump into file at the end of execution. --done. committed.
5. We need to have a delimiter in stats_monitor.da to delimit between multiple executions or raft or paxos, and put that on the second line of the log. i have handled the first line, with the regex.
6. need a code cleanup and re-structure before monday.
