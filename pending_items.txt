List of pending things (TODOs)

1. Throughput using number of client requests - Time taken to process a request. 
	Just plots of requests vs time taken is enough. No need to calculate separately.
2. For now manually delete vrpaxos.log file before each run. Need to find out how logger can create a new file/truncate the file at starting of each run.
3. basic shiviz visualization for raft.da
4. fix missing one or two lines in shiviz log files. This will also fix 2.
	Reason: Logger does not print once or twice due to unknown reasons.
	Possible Solution: Append shiviz logs into temporary buffer inside class and dump into file at the end of execution
